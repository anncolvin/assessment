Ruby 2.3.0

App Name: SI Assessment (aka Lazy Texting Portal)

Description: This is my submission for the technical assessment component of my Startup Institute application. The  instructions were: "Use Twilioâ€™s API to create a web app that sends a standard text message to a user submitted phone number."

Note: This app requires that phone number sending the texts is authorized. If you would like to use this functionality, please send me an e-mail at anncolvin06@gmail.com to request access.
